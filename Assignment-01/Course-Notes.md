# **introduction to python**
## To analyse a data we need python programme which includes libraries and tools.Using python avoids two language problem.Although python runs slowly but it waves the time taken by other programming languages interms of writing the code.
> # NumPy
## Numerical Python provides data structures,algorithms and  library glue.
>
> # pandas
## pandas makes data fast, easy, and expressive.pandas provides indexing functionality,data manupulation,preparation and cleaning.
>
> # matplotlib
## matplotlib produces plots and data visualizations
>
> # Jupyter
## Jupyter notebook create rich documents with code and text.
>
> # statsmodels
## statsmodels focus on statistical inference, predictions.
>
> # Python Interpeter
## Python interpreter runs program by executing one statement at a time.
>
> # Jupyter Notebook 
## It is a interactive document for code,text,data visualizations and output.
>
> # Tab Completion
## pressing the tab key enables to find the computer's filesystem matching what you have typed.
>
> # Introspection
## using question mark will display some general information about object.
>
> # variables and arguments passing
## when assigning a variable ,we create a reference to the object on right hand side of equal sign.For example if we need to assign value of a to b then we use equal sign and if we need to add a new value then we use append command.
>
> # Dynamic references,strong types
## Python is a typed language,the every object has a specific type or class and implicit conversions will occur only in some conditions.isinstance can accept tuple of types.
>
> # Duck typing
## sometimes we do not care type of an object , it is called duck typing.It can be checked by iter function.
>
> # Mutable and immutable objects
## In python lists,dicts,NumPy arrays and user-defined types are mutable.That means they can be modified.
>
> # Scalar Types
- Numeric types
- Strings
- Bytes and Unicode
- Booleans
- Type casting
- Dates and times
> # Control flow
> ## if,elif,and else
> ### if statement is control flow statement checks condition . If its true then executes but if it is false then executes else.
> ## for loops
> ### for loops are for iterating over a collection or an iterater.A for loop can be exited altogether with the break keyword.
> # Ternary expressions
> ## A Ternary expression in Python allows to combine an if-else block that produces value into single line or expression.
